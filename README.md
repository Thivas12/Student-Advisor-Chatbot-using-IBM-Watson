# Student-Advisor-Chatbot-using-IBM-Watson
In this project, I developed a chatbot using IBM Watson services. I did this as a final project for the professional certificate. I created a Coursera Student Advisor chatbot that can answer both "short tail" and "long tail" questions students might have about Coursera and its learning programs. We will use several Watson AI APIs, including Assistant to hold an interactive dialog, and Discovery to answer the "long tail" of questions and to recommand learning resources.

# COMPLETE OVERVIEW AND DESCRIPTION
**CREATE A WATSON DISCOVERY SERVICE** :
After login to the IBM Cloud account, create an instance of Watson Discovery **Note : If you created a Watson Discovery in the past using the Lite plan, you won't be allowed to create a second instance. You can use the instance you already created.**

**CREATE A WATSON ASSISTANT SERVICE**:
From the catalog page that loads, Click on the services, select the AI category and then select the Watson Assistant service from the list. In the Watson Assistant setup page, choose a region depending on where you are located. For example, here we have chosen Dallas. Once the service is created you will see the below page, from where you can launch Watson Assistant. Click on the **Launch Watson Assistant** button to access the web application that will allow you to create chatbots.
